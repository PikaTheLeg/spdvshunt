SpdVSHunt 1.0 (Soft Release)
A complete SpdVsHunt plugin has been created, which implements the following:
-	Added Team Joining functionality with win conditions. (/svh join [speedrunner|hunter|none])
-	Added Lodestone Tracker Compass which tracks last known coordinates of a speedrunner in your current world. These coordinates are saved in a scoreboard for three separate dimensions, hence the plugin should work even when you are in different dimensions!
-	Cycle through speedrunners you track by right clicking the tracker compass. (if there are multiple speedrunners)
-	Added settings: Give hunters an action bar which shows more information like distance and dimensions of the hunters, or give speedrunners a compass to track other speedrunners so they donâ€™t get lost! (/svh settings [hunterBarInfo|runnerCompass])
-	Added reset: If you encounter any game-breaking bugs or just want a rematch in the same world, this clears scoreboards and teams for a restart. (/svh reset) 
-	Added help: My attempt at explaining what each commands do in-game. (/svh help)
-	Support for auto-complete commands to make it less confusing to work with!
-	Replaced messy newbie spaghetti code with less messy newbie spaghetti code. Sorry guys, this is my first real Minecraft plugin after all!
